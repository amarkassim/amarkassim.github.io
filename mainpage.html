                    HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. The virus can be found in some body fluids of an HIV-positive person such as semen or vaginal fluids, blood, and breast milk (although it is true that HIV has been detected in saliva, tears, and urine, though,
                    in very low concentrations). The HIV virus enters the body through open cuts, sores, or breaks in the skin.

                    "Testing HIV seropositive is a dramatic event. This event causes a sudden change in life perspective as the person confronts the reality of progressive physical decline, an insidiously increasing probability of suffering from severe illnesses as the years
                    go by, and a seemingly inevitable early death" (Mulder & Antoni, page 70). Therefore, be mindful when speaking to HIV-positive individuals, especially those who recently learned of the positive status of their HIV infection.

                    "According to the most recent 2007 AIDS Epidemic Update (UNAIDS 2007), an estimated 33.2 million people worldwide were living with HIV. In 2007, there were an estimated 2.5 million new HIV infections and an estimated 2.1 million deaths. Half the persons
                    living with HIV are women (an estimated 15.4 million) and an estimated 2.1 million are children (under the age of 15)" (Cimperman, page 79).

                    "<i>Doing It</i> is a new national HIV testing and prevention campaign designed to motivate all adults to get tested for HIV and know their status. As part of the Act Against AIDS initiative, <i>Doing It</i> delivers the message that HIV
                    testing should be a part of everyone's regular health routine to keep ourselves and our community healthy. He's doing it. She's doing it. We're doing it. YOU should be doing it, too" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
