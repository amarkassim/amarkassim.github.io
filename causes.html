                    Sexual contact is the most common route of HIV transmission in the United States. 57 percent of people infected with HIV in 2009 are men who had sex with other men who were HIV positive. Homosexual Intercourse is the most common way to transmit HIV virus
                    in developed countries while, on the other hand, heterosexual intercourse is the common way to transmit HIV virus in the the less developed and generally poor countries. The reason why sexual intercourse is a risk for HIV transmission
                    is because it allows the exchange of body fluids.

                    <p>
                        Unprotected vaginal sex is the most common way for transmitting HIV worldwide. Studies have shown that male-to-female HIV transmission during vaginal intercourse is a lot likelier than female-to-male HIV transmission. One reason that contributes to this
                        fact is that the United States in its own has a higher percentage of male than female, which means that it is likely that a woman will have sex with multiple men. Another reason lies in the female's sexual organs' structure. The
                        lining of the vagina and cervix that chafe easily are rich in white blood cells that can be infected, thus, accelerating the rate in which the virus spreads.

                        Anal intercourse just like any other way of intercourse is at high risk of transmitting HIV if condoms are not used. Many partners think that by using techniques such as pull-out before ejaculation the virus will not be able to be transmitted. However,
                        the virus can be transmitted through fluids that precede the ejaculation. Being the receptive partner, obviously, puts him/her in a significantly higher risk of receiving HIV.

                <p>
                    Blood, as mentioned previously, is one of the body fluids that can transmit HIV. Nevertheless, chances that HIV would be transmitted through blood transfusion nowadays is very low in developed countries. This is because of meticulous screening and
                    precautions.
