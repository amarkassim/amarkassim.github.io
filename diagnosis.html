                People with HIV who are using antiretroviral therapy (ART) consistently and have suppressed the virus to an undetectable level in the body are unlikely to transmit the virus. However, it is very advised to take into account the risks of HIV transmission.
                A 2011 report issued by CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), USA, found that about one in every 5 HIV-positive Americans is unaware of their HIV-status, and only 49% of those who are aware receive ongoing medical care and
                treatment.

                    A screening specifically for the virus is made in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis. If the HIV virus has been found, the results are going to be "positive." The blood then is re-tested before a conclusion is made known to the patient. It is
                    important that the patient receives treatment as soon as possible if the virus has been detected. This is crucial because the sooner the treatment begins, the more likely it will be effective. Plus, precautions have to made
                    to prevent the virus from spreading.

                    Scientists from Imperial College London reported in Nature Nanotechnology (October 2012 issue) that they "have developed an extremely sensitive sensor that detects viral infections, including HIV" (Nordqvist). The sensor is cheap and is the said to be
                    the most effective tool for detection in the market today.
