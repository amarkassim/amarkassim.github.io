                It's crucial for the infected person to receive early HIV antiretroviral treatment. "It improves the quality of life, extends life expectancy and reduces the risk of transmission, according to the World Health Organization's guidelines issued in June
                2013" (Nordqvist). Currently, there is no vaccine or definite cure for HIV. Nevertheless, different treatment strategies can be effective, improving patients' general health and quality of life.

                    If an individual believes that he has been exposed to the virus within the past 72 hours, anti-HIV medication called PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) may luckily stop the infection. This treatment is quite intensive and needs to be done as soon
                    as possible. The earlier it is done, the more likely the virus hasn't done much damage to the immune system. Though, PEP is associated with irritating side effects such as diarrhea and fatigue. Regular blood tests are necessary to
                    be followed to monitor the activity of the virus and the level of influence PEP has had.

                    HIV is treated regularly with antiretrovirals that help in fighting the infection and slowing the virus down. Generally, patients take a combination of medications called HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy). HAART is a customized combination of
                    different medications that a physician prescribes to an infected person with HIV. The level of effectiveness is determined by multiple factors such as the amount of damage the virus has done already to the immune system, how strong
                    one's immune system is, and the particular strain of the virus. Since HAART can't completely get rid the body of the virus, a routine dosage must be taken every day on a regular schedule for life.

                    The outer shell of HIV has a vulnerable spot, which enabled two HIV-positive people to make antibodies powerful enough to kill off the majority of HIV types known globally. A glycan, which is a form of sugar located in a specific part on the protein coat
                    that covers HIV is a vulnerable spot that allows the body to mount an effective attack using broadly neutralizing antibodies (Nordqvist).

                    The scientists, from the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, said their discovery offers new clues about stimulating the body to produce "broadly neutralizing antibodies." They believe these antibodies are key for making an AIDS vaccine because
                    they effectively eradicate most of the HIV types around the world (Nordqvist).
