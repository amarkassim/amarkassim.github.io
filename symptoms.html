                Symptoms of early HIV infection:
            </h1>
                <p>
                    Many people don't have any symptoms for many years while others may develop symptoms similar to flu. The symptoms can last up to a couple of weeks. Early symptoms can consist of flu, fever, tiredness, weakness, and other related symptoms.
                </p>

            <div id="stageTwo">

                Asymptomatic HIV infection:
            </h1>
                <p>
                    In many cases, after the initial period where early symptoms manifest comes a period of asymptomatic infection. This phase can last for several years. In this period of time, the virus is in constant activity to conquer and damage the immune system.
                    In fact, the infected person will appear healthy and feel quite well.
                </p>

                <h1>
                Late-stage HIV infection:
            </h1>
                <p>
                    In the last stage of HIV infection, the virus has done severe damage to the immune system, making it extremely vulnerable to serious illnesses. This stage of infection is known as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). If left untreated, people who
                    are diagnosed with AIDS typically survive about 3 years. Symptoms of late-stage HIV infection are generally more noticeable and a lot painful than symptoms that appear in the first stage. Symptoms may include a blurred vision, dry
                    cough, permanent tiredness, fever of above 98.6F lasting for weeks, and other related symptoms.
